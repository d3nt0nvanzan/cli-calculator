# Simple Terminal Calculator

## Features

### Version One

1. Everything should be consumed via the terminal
1. Everything should be selected through a numbered menu (also the quit option)
1. Operations managed are: +, -, /, *, and power of `x`
1. When you're about to exit the program, each operation done in the session should be displayed on a different line
1. Write the steps to run the program. Mention the software requirements I should have to run it
1. Remember to "Never trust user input" but you probably already know that!

### Version Two

1. Manage also the floating point numbers for the operation

### Version Three

1. Learn how to create a release for your software. Then, add the instructions for downloading and using it. The version that we'd like to see is `v0.0.1`
2. To add some unit tests in your software. You're left open and free on purpose since I don't know how Python is implementing unit tests and best practices
